# Fang's Personal Website

*by Fang Shuo*

A little bit about me, my projects, and the things I've been doing :-)


## Implementation

- **Languages:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Design:** Photoshop, Illustrator

The initial template for this website came from [HTML5Up](https://html5up.net).

On top of this template, I then designed and implemented the different project pages, using mostly HTML and CSS. Most images were made using Photoshop, while most icons were created using Illustrator.
